# Blood Bank Management System

Welcome to the Blood Bank Management System project! This project is designed to help manage and analyze data for a blood bank. It includes scripts for creating necessary tables, inserting sample data, and running various queries to retrieve and analyze blood bank information.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll find SQL scripts that help in setting up a blood bank management database. The scripts are divided into three main parts:

1. **Creating Tables**: This script sets up the database and defines the structure of various tables.
2. **Inserting Data**: This script populates the tables with sample data to help you get started.
3. **Running Queries**: This script includes various SQL queries to summarize and analyze the data.
